          <h2>Who We Are</h2>
          <p>
            Here at Leaf and Luggage, We are a smol team of four Full Stack Web Developement students enrolled at Atlas Schools located in beautiful downtown Tulsa.
            Our goal with this project was to show off some of the things we have learned since we began our journey into computer sciences, by creating a web guide on
            sustainable and eco-friendly travel, accommodations and activities in a few cites across the United States.
          </p>

            Look for places that harness renewable energy like solar panels, adopt water-saving features such as
            rainwater harvesting, or integrate green design using reclaimed or recycled materials. Every small detail,
            from energy-efficient lighting to natural building methods, contributes to reducing ecological footprints.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many eco-friendly stays also emphasize community partnerships, ensuring that your visit supports local
            farmers, artisans, and projects that aim to strengthen the neighborhood’s sustainability efforts. Responsible
            tourism practices are about more than just the destination—they're about connecting authentically with the
            people and landscapes that make it unique.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether you’re booking a boutique eco-hotel in a city center, exploring a sustainable lodge in the forest,
            or embracing simplicity through green camping retreats, every conscious choice empowers you to create a
            cleaner, greener planet for future generations.
