      <h3>Traditional Practices</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>🔋 Energy Consumption: Heavy reliance on fossil fuels.</li>
        <li>💧 Water Waste: Excessive use for laundry and landscaping.</li>
        <li>♻️ Single-Use Plastics: Mini toiletries and packaging waste.</li>
        <li>🌍 Carbon Emissions: Higher footprint from construction and operations.</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="eco-friendly-practices">
      <h3>Eco-Friendly Practices</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>🔋 Renewable Energy: Solar panels reduce reliance on fossil fuels.</li>
        <li>💧 Water Conservation: 50% less water use with low-flow systems.</li>
        <li>♻️ Zero Waste: Refillable toiletries and composting programs.</li>
        <li>🌍 Reduced Emissions: Carbon offsets and green building designs.</li>

  <div class="eco-impact-container">
    <!-- Column 1: Traditional Impact -->
    <div class="traditional-impact">
      <h3>The Environmental Cost</h3>
      <p>Did you know that traditional hotels consume over 100 kilowatts of energy per guest per night? That’s enough to power a small home for three days! And with millions of gallons of water wasted annually on outdated plumbing and irrigation, the impact adds up quickly. Single-use plastics like mini shampoo bottles alone contribute to over 8 million tons of plastic waste in our oceans each year.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Column 2: Eco-Friendly Impact -->
    <div class="eco-friendly-impact">
      <h3>The Eco-Friendly Difference</h3>
      <p>By choosing a green hotel, you help save up to 50% more energy thanks to solar panels and energy-efficient lighting. Greywater systems and low-flow fixtures can conserve thousands of gallons of water, enough to fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool over a year! Plus, eco-friendly stays reduce plastic waste by offering refillable toiletries and biodegradable packaging.</p>

  </div>

  <!-- Fun Fact Highlight -->
  <div class="fun-fact">
    <p>🌱 Fun Fact: If every hotel switched to renewable energy, we could prevent over 1.5 billion tons of carbon emissions annually—that’s like taking 300 million cars off the road!</p>
